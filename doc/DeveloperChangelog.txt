-> fixed bug in addNewAnimeWindow
    -> when Anime name contains only a space
        -> it will be accepted and appears in list but it cannot be editted nor deleted nor incremented
            -> you can do nothing with it
-> added new feature
    -> add-button only is enabled when user input is correct
        -> works while user types



+++ 2018-12-14 +++
-> fixed bug: in editAnimeWindow: anime name can be changed to anime name which is in Completed Animelist
-> current state: stable



+++ 2018-10-05 +++
-> current state: stable
    -> current version: Anwalic 1.4 DevBuild 1.1
        -> DevBuild 1.1 done
-> replaced old code for Filter "Show Open Ended Animes"
-> replaced old code for Filter "Hide Movies"
-> replaced old code for Filter "Hide Open Ended Animes"
-> replaced old code for Filter "Hide Animes With Name Only"
-> replaced old code for Filter "Filter By Tag"
-> replaced old code for Filter "Show Started Animes Only"



+++ 2018-10-03 +++
-> current state: stable
-> replaced old code in MainWindow.cpp for Filter "Show Movies Only" with new code from
   class FilterShowMovies
!! there may be a code quality issue because for the class FilterShowMovies
   the pointer for AnimelistManager is passed out of the class AnwalicService as NOT CONST.
   But FilterShowMovies needs to modify FilteredAnimelist inside AnimelistManager, so it must be not const.
    !! can be resolved by making AnwalicService a FRIEND CLASS to get access to its
       private attributes



+++ 2018-09-30 +++
-> implemented abstract class "FilterAnimelist"
    -> added method "applyFilter"
    -> method "clearFilter" and "enableUiElements" not needed since
       you can press on button "Clear Filter" and it performs all this.
-> updated documentation in code and feature planning
-> [NEXT IS] inherit class "FilterAnimelist" and create a Filter. And
   replace the bad code in MainWindow with the invokation of this new class.



+++ 2018-09-29 +++
-> finished diagrams
    -> class diagram: FilterAnimelist
    -> sequence diagram: applyFilter
    -> sequence diagram: removeFilter



+++ 2018-09-28 +++
-> preparing diagrams for feature "FilterAnime"
    -> it has just been implemented but the code quality is shit
        -> a new class "FilterAnime" is needed to



+++ 2018-03-10 +++
-> implemented: Hide Movies
-> implemented: Show Open Ended Animes
-> implemented: Hide Open Ended Animes
-> renamed menu item: "Show Movies Only" to "Show Movies"
-> implemented: Filter by Tag
-> fixed issues when filtering completed animelist
-> removed menu item "Search by Tag (Ctrl+F)"
    -> feature is already there when you focus the animelist and start typing.
       It automatically selects the anime which matches your typing



+++ 2018-03-09 +++
-> implemented: add sub-program-version for debug build
-> implemented: vorgemerkte Animes verbergen 
    -> added methid: hideAnimesWithNameOnly



+++ 2018-03-08 +++
-> implemented: allow filter for completed list



+++ 2018-03-07 +++
-> AnwalicService now handles openURL, previously MainWindow was calling openURL directly
-> improved code readibility in class Anime & Animelist
-> updated dependency graph
    -> there is one cyclic dependency problem between SaveLoad & ErrorView
        -> ErrorView is only calling static methods from SaveLoad, so there is no problem with the implementation
-> added implementation to open website animefreak.tv
-> found bug: quitting program while list is filtered leads to crash
    -> fixed: anime objects have been double deleted by AnimelistManager in filtered animelist
-> added code documentation for class memory



+++ 2018-03-06 +++
-> organized which the new features will be
-> new features are

        -> animefreak.tv
    -> more coming in DevBuild 2
-> added new UI elements for above features
    -> not implemented yet

    # GENERAL INFORMATION:                                                                                                  #
    # DevBuild 6 is changing the architecture of the code drastically.                                                      #
    # Too many things are in MainWindow. MainWindow's purpose is to handle the UI                                           #
    # and not e.g. find animes in list.                                                                                     #
    #                                                                                                                       #
    # ANWALIC SERVICE:                                                                                                      #
    # All methods that do not have anything to do with MainWindow such as the "find anime in list" method are               #
    # being extracted to a service class AnwalicService which contains the business logic.                                  #
    #                                                                                                                       #
    # ANIMELIST MANAGER:                                                                                                    #
    # And I introduce another class: AnimelistManager.                                                                      #
    # That class manages the switching of the different lists:                                                              #
    # My Anime List (previously called Now Watching Animes), Completed Anime List, Filtered Anime List                      #
    #                                                                                                                       #

    # loading and saving the lists will be handled by the new class SaveLoad                                                #

HOW TO EXTRACT:
// extract to AnwalicService.h and .cpp   (all business logic such as finding, sorting, filtering, removing. BUT adding, removing etc.
//                                         needs to be passed to AnimelistManager. AnwalicService receives all requests)
// extract to AnimelistManager.h and .cpp (everything for getting/setting/switching lists and adding, deleting animes)
